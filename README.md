# SIEMENS Conveyor Belt Module with S7-1500 Digital Twin Project

🚀 **Welcome to the SIEMENS Conveyor Belt Module 6ZB2310-0AP00 with S7-1500 Digital Twin project!** This project simulates and controls a **conveyor belt system** using a digital twin approach, combining 3D modeling, real-time simulation, and industrial communication protocols.  

## Key Components  
- **3D Modeling**: Blender for modeling conveyor belt and environment assets.  
- **Simulation Engine**: Unity 3D for physics-based dynamics and visualization.  
- **Industrial Communication**: OPC UA and TCP sockets for PLC data exchange.  

## Purpose  
- Virtual testing of conveyor logic (start/stop, speed control, object detection).  
- Real-time monitoring via a Unity interface.  
- Protocol integration for industrial interoperability (e.g., OPC UA servers).
